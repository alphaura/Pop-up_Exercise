        <p>This is a pop-up I've worked on while following a lesson of a course on <a href="https://www.skillshare.com/en/classes/The-Basics-of-Web-Design-Layout-Learn-How-To-Describe-Your-Design-With-HTML-CSS/1282829766">SkillShare </a>, on how the fixed position works and also in creating a basic pop-up.<br>
          <br>
     To further test my current knowledge, I have added a hyperlink to the Skillshare course, alongside some extra styling of the text and link.
